Hi! I am a senior math major at UT Austin. I am a member of the [Deans Scholars Honors program](https://cns.utexas.edu/academics/undergraduate-study/honors-programs/deans-scholars), and am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Eunsol Choi](https://eunsol.github.io), [Prof. Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/#research), and [Prof. Richard Tsai](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ytsai/).

<br>

My research is in Natural Language Processing; specifically, model editing. The goal of my research is to develop a better understanding of the knowledge graphs within language models, and leverage that understanding in creating effective and efficient editing methods. More broadly, I am also interested in interpretability, meta-learning, and deep learning theory.
